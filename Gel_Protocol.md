## general notes

I'm running and making all gels with 1x SB Buffer

Don't pour bioling hot gel into gel rig. Needs to cool a bit. You can use a bucket of ice to speed this up.

##required reagents

- Ethidium Bromide
- SB Buffer
- agarose
- s

## Recipes
###20X SB Buffer

- 45g boric acid
- 8g NaOH
- 1L H2O
- to make 1X working buffer
	- 1 liter: 50ml 20x into 950ml water
	- 5 liters: 250ml 20x into 4.75 liters water

##Quick and dirty check for high molecular weight dna

Use this if you just want to check quality of extracted DNA. 

1.5% gel, 200V, 28 min

- note, you could probably use a 1% gel for even less time. I just haven't tested this.

Making small gel:

- 1.1 g agarose into 70 ml 1x SB Buffer
	- 3ul etbr after gel is heated, but before it solidifies. 
- 2ul dna, 2ul dye.
	- currently using xylene cyanol 6x
- Load between 3-4 ul dye dna combo
- Can reuse gel 3-4 times. Add 1.5 ul etbr to melted gel before each run
- Ladder:
	- dna ladder : 1ul
	- water: 9ul
	- combine 2 ul diluted ladder with 2 ul dye
